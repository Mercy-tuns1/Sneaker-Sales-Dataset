 - Diourbel is the weakest performer in both sales and units sold, requiring further investigation.
 - Western and Volta show steady performance, contributing over $80,000 in sales.
 - Some locations have high unit sales but lower revenue per unit, which suggests possible price variations or discount strategies

 - Adidas Samba had the best individual quarter performance in Q3 ($36,714.95).
 - Q3 was the best quarter overall, indicating peak sales or efficiency.
 - In-store sales are slightly higher than online sales, but the difference is not significant (around 7.2% higher).
